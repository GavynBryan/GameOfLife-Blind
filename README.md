# GameOfLife-Blind
Blind attempt at implementing Conway's Game of Life. (Meaning no tutorials or outside help was used)
It was a neat little exercise. However my implementation is not well optimized and will run slowly on older hardware. Please give it some time. 

It requires the SFML library to run.

I may upload a different version with insight I got after seeing other peoples' implementations.
